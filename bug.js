function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b; 
}

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2

//This is a simple example but it can be very difficult to debug when dealing with complex programs
//The issue is that the subtract function doesn't work correctly when subtracting negative numbers
